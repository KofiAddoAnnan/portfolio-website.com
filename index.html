                    <p>The two (2) TIP41C NPN transistors are used for switching in the converter circuit. The 18650 battery
                        outputs about 2-3 amps to the base of the TIP41 transistors. The current begins to flow from the base to
                        the emitter until the transistor is ‘ON’.
                        The ‘ON’ and ‘OFF’ operation of the TIP41 transistors causes current to flow through the 24-0-24 toroidal
                        inductor. At this point, the inductor stores energy in its magnetic field. When the TIP41 transistor is in its
                        ‘OFF’ state, there is a sudden drop of the inductor current and this change in inductor current produces a

                        This voltage is supplied to the two (2) 12V cooling fans connected in series. The 3300µF capacitor is

                    <h2>Project Description</h2>
                    <p>A basic prototype of a wired battery management system is built which performs the following functions; Charge the lithium-ion battery, limit the charging current, and  perform battery balancing.

                        The lithium-ion battery usually has a nominal voltage of 3.7V and about 4.2V when fully charged. This
                        wired battery management system is designed to charge a 3S battery pack of lithium-ion cells individually
                        having different internal structures. Thus, one cell will charge faster than the other due to different discharge
                        rates or internal resistances.

                        The BD140 transistor is connected in series with the four (4) 1N4007 diodes. A TL431 zener reference diode
                        is connected to the base of the transistor. This connection is purposely for the TL431 zener reference diode
                        to open at a voltage value which is 4.2V when the lithium-ion battery is fully charged. At this instance,
                        when the BD140 transistor is active, the charging current will bypass the battery and go through the four
                        (4) 1N4007 diodes connected in series with the transistor. This power will be wasted on the diodes hence
                        the circuit is less efficient. Also, this charging current will light up the LED to indicate full charge. The
                        reference pin of the TL431 zener is connected to the 20k potentiometer hence by adjusting the potentiometer
                        value to the 4.2V, the charging process stops at that voltage value. By this process, passive cell balancing is
                        achieved while charging the 3S battery pack.</p>

                        Loads.</h1>
                    <h2>Project Description</h2>
                    <p>A prototype of a wireless power transmission system which works under the principle of electromagnetic
                        mutual induction is built. A 230VAC is stepped down by the 220V/12V transformer. This 12VAC is fed
                        to the full bridge rectifier circuit. Here, the AC voltage is converted to a pulsating DC voltage by the four
                        1n4007 diodes and the 2200uF capacitor. The rippled output of the rectifier is smoothened by the 2200uF
                        capacitor into a more DC output voltage.

                        A 12V voltage regulator is used to maintain a constant voltage. Also, there is an led used as an indicator to show that the circuit functions properly. The TTC5200 transistor generates a high frequency AC
                        current across the coil thus creating a magnetic field around it. This magnetic field is transferred to the coil
                        at the receiver side by the Faraday’s law of induction. Another rectifier circuit is installed at the receiver
                        side to ensure the AC voltage is converted to DC. The EMF generated is used to light the LEDs and power
                        the USB charger by the help of 5V voltage regulator. A 2-way switch is used to switch between the two
                        loads.</p>

                    <h2>Project Abstract</h2>
                    <p>For the past two decades, the world has experienced a paradigm shift towards renewable sources of energy
                    such as the solar power, wind, and the hydro power. Our pursuit for cleaner energies is the major reason electric vehicles are being fully realized on our roads
                    today. For another reason, electric vehicles are moreefficient than the conventional combustion engine cars.
                    Electric vehicles on our roads today have three charging modes; conductive charging (AC/DC), wireless charging and battery swap. All these methods are realizable
                    but have their advantages and disadvantages. Wireless charging of electric vehicles stands out in terms of efficiency, charging time, reliability, low volume, reduced
                    cost and weight. Again, with the major deployment of autonomous driving of electric vehicles, robot taxis will be realizable within the next 3 to 5 years. The
                    only charging mode that can be thought of when the taxis are to take power snacks is the wireless charging mode. The main purpose of this paper is to review
                    the power electronic circuitry of the wireless chargers which consists of several power converter types and their
                    voltage waveforms at each conversion stage. The seriesseries compensation topology is employed in this study</p>

                    <p>As traffic on the urban Ghanaian road network increases, congestion and delays are becoming more severe. Traffic
                        signals are the most common method by which right of way is dynamically allocated to conflicting movements.
                        Ghanaian traffic light control system is mainly designed by using devices such as timers, relays etc. The
                        critical timing operation is required to be carried out under the existence of heavy traffic situations. This
                        does not give this conventional traffic light control system the flexibility to control throughput to favor
                        emergency vehicles. This conventional practice leads to many problems and subsequent delay for a long
                        time. With the help of a PLC, the requirement of fast automation and effective optimization of traffic light
                        control even in times of emergency can be achieved.
                        At intersections, capacity bottlenecks are formed in urban road networks because at these locations,
                        capacity must be shared by competing traffic movements. For this reason, this thesis introduces an
                        execution and implementation of T-junction emergency traffic control system using SEIMENS S7-200 PLC.
                        Programming in PLC is written in ladder logic with the help of STEP7 MICROWIN software.</p>

                    <h1>Development of Encoder-Multivariate Time-Series Transformer for Remaining Useful Life Prediction of IGBTs (Under Review)</h1>
                    <h2>Abstract</h2>
                    <p>Power electronic converters (PECs) are crucial to modern electrical systems, facilitating efficient energy conversion in applications from renewable energy systems, electric vehicles, to industrial drives. 
                        To mitigate risks of extended downtime, financial losses, and health hazards associated to failure of critical PEC components like Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistors (IGBTs) while in operation, 
                        several data-driven machine learning models have been proposed in literature to estimate their remaining useful life (RUL) in order to improve system reliability and perform predictive maintenance 
                        of these critical components of the power electronic converter based on National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA’s) accelerated aging datasets. However, reliance on recurrence in machine 
                        learning models in literature mainly lack robustness and accuracy due to the size and patterns of the NASA accelerated aging dataset. This paper develops a novel data-driven approach to this issue. 
                        For the IGBTs, a new Transformer model, the Encoder-Transformer, is developed for RUL multivariate time-series forecasting. It employs the multi-head attention mechanism to capture long-term dependencies 
                        and outperforms traditional RNN architectures—Simple Recurrent Neural Network (Simple RNN), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). The Encoder-Transformer was found to be superior
                        compared to Simple RNN, GRU, and LSTM with RMSE of 14.90, 105.14, 78.84 and 92.78 for IGBT 4 generalization respectively based on RUL with units in seconds, trained on NASA’s IGBT 2 dataset using the steady-state 
                        data precursors. The proposed data-driven method produces robust, scalable solutions for component level prognostics.</p>
